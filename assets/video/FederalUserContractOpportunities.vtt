of the other changes in terminology

0:01:45.890 --> 0:01:53.539

0:02:33.110 --> 0:02:38.430
additionally beta.Sam.gov is

0:04:16.640 --> 0:04:21.350
simply canceled so users should not be

0:04:19.700 --> 0:04:24.140
alarmed if these options appear slightly

0:04:21.350 --> 0:04:26.270
different on their screen to start

0:04:51.110 --> 0:04:56.690
linking it to that existing solicitation

0:04:53.780 --> 0:04:59.140
for example if you have an existing

0:04:56.690 --> 0:05:02.120

0:10:12.550 --> 0:10:17.650
drafts so once a draft is created it

0:10:15.760 --> 0:10:19.450
will be available until it is manually

0:10:17.650 --> 0:10:22.990
deleted by a user with the proper

0:10:19.450 --> 0:10:25.390
permissions work through the sections

0:10:22.990 --> 0:10:27.790
one by one and make sure that all

0:10:25.390 --> 0:10:31.660
pertinent information has been changed

0:10:27.790 --> 0:10:35.200
as a note if you are looking to change

0:10:31.660 --> 0:10:38.060
the solicitation type for example from

0:10:35.200 --> 0:10:39.620
pre-solicitation to solicitation

0:10:38.060 --> 0:10:42.440
you will need to create a new

0:10:39.620 --> 0:10:44.060
opportunity when you create the new

0:10:42.440 --> 0:10:47.870
opportunity and link it to the previous

0:10:44.060 --> 0:10:50.000
one beta.Sam.gov will automatically link

0:10:47.870 --> 0:10:51.920
the two opportunities postings and

0:10:50.000 --> 0:10:56.300
transfer the core data to the newest

0:10:51.920 --> 0:10:59.410
version use the attachments workspace to

0:10:56.300 --> 0:11:02.240
modify your opportunities attachments

0:10:59.410 --> 0:11:04.940
you have the ability to add and remove

0:11:02.240 --> 0:11:07.010
documents here if you are adding

0:11:04.940 --> 0:11:09.050
documents you don't have to worry about

0:11:07.010 --> 0:11:12.710
submitting documentation to appear as

0:11:09.050 --> 0:11:14.720
amendments users will not receive

0:11:12.710 --> 0:11:16.970
notifications regarding changes in

0:11:14.720 --> 0:11:20.420
attachments until the draft notice has

0:11:16.970 --> 0:11:22.250
been published once published vendors

0:11:20.420 --> 0:11:24.920
following the posting will be notified

0:11:22.250 --> 0:11:26.870
of the updates by uploading new

0:11:24.920 --> 0:11:28.730
documents vendors will be notified

0:11:26.870 --> 0:11:32.300
automatically that the posting has been

0:11:28.730 --> 0:11:34.370
updated within the post the date that a

0:11:32.300 --> 0:11:36.800
document was attached will be displayed

0:11:34.370 --> 0:11:39.380
next to each attachment so that vendors

0:11:36.800 --> 0:11:42.650
will be able to discern which document

0:11:39.380 --> 0:11:44.870
was uploaded most recently while the

0:11:42.650 --> 0:11:47.870
system may not automatically register a

0:11:44.870 --> 0:11:49.820
new upload as an amendment users can

0:11:47.870 --> 0:11:51.800
still incorporate the word amendment

0:11:49.820 --> 0:11:56.420
within the file name to make it

0:11:51.800 --> 0:11:58.340
additionally discernable to vendors once

0:11:56.420 --> 0:12:01.460
you have updated all pertinent fields

0:11:58.340 --> 0:12:03.740
and verified all entries click the blue

0:12:01.460 --> 0:12:06.440
publish button towards the top of the

0:12:03.740 --> 0:12:08.210
screen should the publish button be

0:12:06.440 --> 0:12:10.370
disabled it is likely due to a

0:12:08.210 --> 0:12:13.760
validation error regarding one of the

0:12:10.370 --> 0:12:16.010
entries within the posting if you cannot

0:12:13.760 --> 0:12:18.440
publish either look for the error banner

0:12:16.010 --> 0:12:20.390
at the top of the screen or look for the

0:12:18.440 --> 0:12:22.250
section on the left side of the screen

0:12:20.390 --> 0:12:25.550
that has an exclamation point rather

0:12:22.250 --> 0:12:27.200
than a green check mark once all

0:12:25.550 --> 0:12:29.360
outstanding input errors have been

0:12:27.200 --> 0:12:32.780
resolved you will be able to publish

0:12:29.360 --> 0:12:34.910
your posting you will be notified that

0:12:32.780 --> 0:12:37.550
all the changes you've made will become

0:12:34.910 --> 0:12:40.010
public should you proceed click OK to

0:12:37.550 --> 0:12:41.600
finish editing your opportunity users

0:12:40.010 --> 0:12:44.000
with the role of contract officer

0:12:41.600 --> 0:12:47.780
looking to delete a contract opportunity

0:12:44.000 --> 0:12:49.060
to bethe sam.gov can begin by logging in

0:12:47.780 --> 0:12:52.060
to beta I am

0:12:49.060 --> 0:12:54.190
and navigating to their workspace once

0:12:52.060 --> 0:12:56.680
in your workspace about halfway down the

0:12:54.190 --> 0:12:59.710
page will be a widget headed contract

0:12:56.680 --> 0:13:01.750
opportunities there are several options

0:12:59.710 --> 0:13:04.210
within this widget through which you can

0:13:01.750 --> 0:13:06.370
delete an opportunity but we recommend

0:13:04.210 --> 0:13:10.150
that you click contract opportunities

0:13:06.370 --> 0:13:12.640
workspace once in the contract

0:13:10.150 --> 0:13:14.530
opportunities workspace you will find a

0:13:12.640 --> 0:13:17.770
dashboard through which you can find in

0:13:14.530 --> 0:13:21.160
search for all active inactive completed

0:13:17.770 --> 0:13:24.790
and draft contract opportunities on beta.

0:13:21.160 --> 0:13:27.190
Sam.gov we want to note here that

0:13:24.790 --> 0:13:30.100
the ability to delete either draft

0:13:27.190 --> 0:13:33.160
notices or published opportunities is

0:13:30.100 --> 0:13:35.440
permission dependent so if you find any

0:13:33.160 --> 0:13:37.090
options locked contact your

0:13:35.440 --> 0:13:39.040
administrator because you will likely

0:13:37.090 --> 0:13:42.820
need to be delegated these advanced

0:13:39.040 --> 0:13:45.550
permissions to delete an opportunity

0:13:42.820 --> 0:13:48.960
begin by locating the pertinent contract

0:13:45.550 --> 0:13:52.600
opportunity and clicking its blue title

0:13:48.960 --> 0:13:55.030
once on that opportunities page locate

0:13:52.600 --> 0:13:58.270
the drop-down menu labeled actions and

0:13:55.030 --> 0:14:02.260
select inactive to make the opportunity

0:13:58.270 --> 0:14:04.900
inactive that contract opportunity is

0:14:02.260 --> 0:14:07.120
now no longer publicly accessible and

0:14:04.900 --> 0:14:10.270
all that will remain is an archived

0:14:07.120 --> 0:14:11.800
record of the post all users following

0:14:10.270 --> 0:14:14.680
the post will be notified of the status

0:14:11.800 --> 0:14:16.890
change of the post should you need to

0:14:14.680 --> 0:14:19.540
reopen a post for any reason in that

0:14:16.890 --> 0:14:23.320

0:14:19.540 --> 0:14:25.690
option reactivate click this option to

0:14:23.320 --> 0:14:27.430
reactivate the opportunity which will

0:14:25.690 --> 0:14:30.280
create a draft notice which can then be

0:14:27.430 --> 0:14:33.040
published any active post that is

0:14:30.280 --> 0:14:35.110
deleted and designated cancelled will

0:14:33.040 --> 0:14:38.640
display canceled as the status of the

0:14:35.110 --> 0:14:38.640
post to notify vendors

0:14:43.510 --> 0:14:49.019
