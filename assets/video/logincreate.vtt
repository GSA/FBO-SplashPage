00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.066
There is a new login process for SAM.gov.

00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:08.033
Whether you have an active account in SAM.gov,

00:00:08.033 --> 00:00:10.166
are registering for the first time,

00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:12.133
or you are renewing your current registration,

00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:17.400
GSA now requires all SAM.gov users to create a new account through Login.gov.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.466
This is easy to do directly from SAM.gov and provides stronger security through multi-factor authentication

00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:26.500
when you access SAM.gov in the future.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.000
As you prepare to create your account on Login.gov, you need three things:

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.466
1) the email address associated with your SAM account,

00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:38.566
2) access to that email to receive a confirmation notification,

00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:41.333
and 3) access to a working phone.

00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:46.033
You will also receive a personal key that is generated after you create your account.

00:00:46.033 --> 00:00:51.033
Please be sure to save the personal key in case you ever need to recover your Login.gov account.

00:00:51.033 --> 00:00:55.900
If you are an entity administrator, your access to registrations and roles will transfer over,

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.533
provided you use the same email from your SAM account.

00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:05.900
If you use the same email when you create your login.gov account, you will automatically be  associated with your entity registration.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:12.266
If you choose a different email for login.gov, you will need to request your roles from your entity administrator.

00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:16.566
Select the Log In  button which will take you to a page to create an account.

00:01:16.566 --> 00:01:19.633
Select Create an Account to get started.

00:01:19.633 --> 00:01:23.566
First, you will be prompted to put in your SAM account email address.

00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:27.266
Please check and confirm your email address before you proceed.

00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:34.800
When you Confirm your Email, it will take you to a seperate page where you will create your password.  After you create a strong password, select an option for receiving your one time passcode

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.100
After you create a strong password, select an option for receiving your one-time passcode.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.066
If you want to save the passcode and simplify access in the future, select the option

00:01:45.066 --> 00:01:50.966
to “Remember this browser for thirty days.”

00:01:50.966 --> 00:01:54.800
Once you enter the one-time passcode, you will be given a Personal Key.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.566
It is very important that you write it down and keep it somewhere safe.

00:01:58.566 --> 00:02:04.033
The Personal Key will help you to reset your password or help you log in when you do not have access to your phone.

00:02:04.033 --> 00:02:06.300
You are now granted access to SAM.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.933
Note that every time you log in to SAM you will be required to enter your email and password,

00:02:10.933 --> 00:02:16.000
then enter the one-time passcode which will be sent via your preferred method.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.500
More information about setting up your account in Login.gov

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.366
can be found by contacting the federal service desk.
