00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.933
In this video, we'll talk about Search

00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:13.499
a core feature of beta.SAM.gov.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:21.000
You can use the search tool in beta.SAM.gov to find the same data that currently exists in the legacy systems.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.233
Beta.SAM.gov is organized by “domain” rather than by legacy system.

00:00:26.233 --> 00:00:30.833
Different types of award domains make up the heart of beta.SAM.gov.

00:00:30.833 --> 00:00:36.966
There are several ways to use Search in SAM, and today we’re going to demonstrate some of those features.

00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:42.332
If you know what contract, business, or assistance listing you’re looking for,

00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:46.699
the easiest way to find it is entering a unique id into the search bar.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:54.500
A unique id might be a Contract number, a Unique entity identifier, Solicitation ID, or CFDA number.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.500
 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.666
First, let’s search by Entity ID.

00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:06.399
If you’re searching in “All Domains” and type the Entity ID you’re looking for, your search results will be displayed.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.833
When searching across all domains, you can use the filters on the left to narrow your search results.

00:01:11.833 --> 00:01:15.533
You can also sort your search results by title or date modified.

00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:16.666
 

00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:19.432
Second, let’s search by keywords.

00:01:19.433 --> 00:01:23.999
Think of one or two keywords you’d like to search and type them in the search bar.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.733
For example, if you’re looking for information on transportation,

00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:31.999
you will type in keywords that relate to transportation under All Domains,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.433
and you may see results displayed across multiple award domains.

00:01:35.433 --> 00:01:39.999
Let’s try a keyword search in a specific domain such as Assistance Listings.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
You’ll notice here the search results will only display for that domain

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.466
And remember each award domain aligns with a specific legacy system.

00:01:48.466 --> 00:01:55.399
Now, let’s search within a specific award domain such as Contract Data and see what information is available.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:01.666
This domain gives you the opportunity to select additional filtering options to further narrow your search.

00:02:01.666 --> 00:02:05.699
The additional filters include contract type, entity ID,

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:12.766
and service classifications for narrowing your contract award search results to a specific NAICS or PSC code.

00:02:12.766 --> 00:02:13.599
 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.900
Last, let’s search by Wage Determination.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:24.000
You can search by the ID number or if you don’t know the ID number, you can use the workflow

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.166
to find the correct wage determination.

00:02:27.166 --> 00:02:33.099
You’ll notice the Wage Determination filters ask a series of questions to narrow your search

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.166
To further narrow your search, use the additional filtering options.

00:02:38.166 --> 00:02:41.366
 

00:02:41.366 --> 00:02:46.966
Once you’ve made your selections, you will only see results displayed based on your filters.

00:02:46.966 --> 00:02:50.932
 

00:02:50.933 --> 00:02:57.766

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.000
 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.133
